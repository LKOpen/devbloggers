FAQs:

What is this ?  
  A place where you can learn, code (coming soon) and compare programming 
  languages by example.

How does it work ?  
  Take a problem and solve it in multiple programming languages. Provide a 
  single view comparision of the solution from all languages for readers
  (http://learnwithlk.appspot.com/). Hope is that this view provides some 
  insight into the approach and constructs used in these languages to solve 
  the same problem and see which one you think is suitable for your use 
  case. Even better, share your opinion with others with a reference.

Why ?  
  I came across such question where I need to pick a programming language 
  and ended up writing a program myself and saw it working to compare. I 
  thought it might be useful for all to have this info handy.

Who's code is this anyway ?  
  Mine to start with. I am hoping to invite more developers to join and 
  contribute.

Can I join ?  
  I am working on a procedure to include most if not all coders who are 
  interested in. Plesae wait for the update and contact me once announced 
  on this page or on the website.

Till then ?  
  You are free to check out this repository and try out few things yourself.

I am a Pro Developer  
  Then, I am sure you know most of it already. Your suggestions will help
  a lot of folks. I am working on a blog for each problem solved so that
  experts like yourself can comment on the code and give constructive 
  suggestions to the author of the code.
